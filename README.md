# Weather-app-JS

In this project, I learned how to create a Weather App Website using HTML CSS, and JavaScript. We will get the current weather data from Fess API key from OpenWeatherMap
and display the weather information like Temperature,  Weather conditions, Humidity, and Wind Speed according to the city on our website or app.
Here I displayed the weather information on the website from Free API using JavaScript.
In this weather app, I also added one search box where users can enter the city name and get the weather information of the particular city.
